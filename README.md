# Corona-Detector-Project
The idea for the solution to the coronavirus outbreak is:
Stop the transmission by prioritizing tests and hence detecting the cases quickly.
Data can be collected on the symptoms of COVID-19.
A machine learning model is then trained on the data to find out the probability of a person having the infection.
The model is then used to find out whom to test for the infection first under a limited testing capacity.
The same model can be used to find potential candidates for conducting random tests.
