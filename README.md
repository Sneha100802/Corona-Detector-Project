# Corona-Detector-Project
The idea for the solution to the coronavirus outbreak is:
1. Stop the transmission by prioritizing tests and hence detecting the cases quickly.
2. Data can be collected on the symptoms of COVID-19.
3. A machine learning model is then trained on the data to find out the probability of a person having the infection.
4. The model is then used to find out whom to test for the infection first under a limited testing capacity.
5. The same model can be used to find potential candidates for conducting random tests.

Technologies used : HTML, Bootstrap , Python ,
